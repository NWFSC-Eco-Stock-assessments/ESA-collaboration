## Eco/Stock assessments repository
Repository for the 2021 Oceanscapes Ecos/Stock Assessment Team

The NWFSC Eco/Stock Assessment Team is a cross-divisional team (Fisheries Resource and Monitoring, Conservation Biology and Fish Ecology) at NWFSC. The team's will be working on analyses and visualization of fisheries-dependent and -independent data to inform both groundfish stock assessments and integrated ecosystem assessments (IEA). Potential projects include 1) analysis of ecosytem drivers and associated responses, 2) estimation of species-specific habitats in the context of fishing gear utilization, 3) incorporation of ecosystem considerations into stock assessments, 4) visualization of IEA indicator distributions and trends, and/or 5) development of a strata explorer app.
